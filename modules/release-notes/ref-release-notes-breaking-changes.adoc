== `dynamicPlugins.cache.volumeClaimSpec` removed from the Helm Chart, dynamic plugin storage now ephemeral

The `dynamicPlugins.cache.volumeClaimSpec` field has been removed from `values.yaml`, making all dynamic plugin storage ephemeral by default. Instead of the Helm chart managing PVC creation, you must now manually configure ephemeral volume claims under `extraVolumes`.

This change also resolves issues with running multi-replica {product-very-short} deployments, as using a Persistent Volume for the Dynamic Plugins cache previously led to potential write conflicts.
