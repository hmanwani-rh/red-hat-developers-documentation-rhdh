== Change in sign-in resolver configuration location

Previously, configuring the sign-in resolver to bypass user provisioning in the {product-short} software catalog required setting `dangerouslyAllowSignInWithoutUserInCatalog: true` at the root of the `{my-app-config-file}` file.

In this release, this configuration has been deprecated at the root level and moved to the resolver configuration section. It now applies specifically to that resolver. For more details, see link:{authentication-book-title}[{authentication-book-url}].
