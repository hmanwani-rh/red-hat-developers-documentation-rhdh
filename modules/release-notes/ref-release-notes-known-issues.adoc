== Add button is misaligned on Bulk Import page

On the *Bulk Import* page, the *Add* button may occasionally appear in the top-left corner instead of its intended position in the bottom-right corner. Despite the misalignment, the button remains fully functional.

== Topology plugin permission is not displayed in the RBAC front-end UI

Permissions associated only with front-end plugins do not appear in the UI because they require a backend plugin to expose the permission framework&#39;s well-known endpoint. As a workaround, you can apply these permissions by using a CSV file or directly calling the REST API of the RBAC backend plugin. Affected plugins include Topology (`topology.view.read`), Tekton (`tekton.view.read`), ArgoCD (`argocd.view.read`), and Quay (`quay.view.read`).
